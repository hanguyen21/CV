## [HA NGUYEN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannguyen22/)

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, having realised a lifelong passion for software development. I am passionate about Ruby and Javascript with a thirst for discovering new languages and frameworks.

With a background in Digital Marketing, I have developed a strong set of problem solving, collaborative and management skills.

I love programming as it gives me the freedom to create and innovate and it offers the opportunity to push exciting new boundaries while improving user experiences.

Throughout my career, I would always think of ways to improve our processes while keeping abreast of innovations in the sector and I am now particularly excited to be able to use my technical knowledge to build solutions to help solve real world problems, whether in my personal projects or in a workplace.
