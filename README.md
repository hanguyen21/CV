## HA NGUYEN

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, having realised a lifelong passion for software development. I am passionate about Ruby and Javascript with a thirst for discovering new languages and frameworks.

With a background in Digital Marketing, I have developed a strong set of problem solving, collaborative and management skills.

I love programming as it gives me the freedom to create and innovate and it offers the opportunity to push exciting new boundaries while improving user experiences.

Throughout my career, I would always think of ways to improve our processes while keeping abreast of innovations in the sector and I am now particularly excited to be able to use my technical knowledge to build solutions to help solve real world problems, whether in my personal projects or in a workplace.

## Projects üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

### [Whatever the Weather](https://github.com/hanguyen21/Whatever-the-Weather)

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2023 - July 2023)
- Worked with test driven development using RSpec and Jest for integration and unit testing on a number of projects with CRUD functionality. Also worked with Cypress for component testing in React.
- Followed Agile methodology while working in teams with other developers while developing full-stack applications from scratch, as well as from existing code bases.
- Developed a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming principles through a variety of projects and challenges in both Ruby and JavaScript.
- Worked with closely with PostgreSQL and MondgoDB. The former in conjunction with Ruby and Sinatra for an Airbnb clone. The later in two larger MERN stack projects.
- Became very comfortable creating and working on REST APIs using Node.js and Express.

#### Bournemouth University ( January 2018 to July 2020)

- MSc. Retail Management and Marketing
